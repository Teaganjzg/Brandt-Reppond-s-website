## Purpose of This Project
Brandt Reppond is a junior audio enginer who is interning at a studio. He wants a website that can help him land a job in the audio industry
and build his brand, it should be able to show his basic information and his work to impress the audiences and leave the audiences a 
professional and musical impression of him.

## Design & sketches
I used browser design and scretch to plan out what this website should look like and feel. It's basically planing out the structure, color,
typeface and make a sketch by hand then code and view in browser see how it looks like then make adjustments and go back to see the result,
repeat till you are satisfied.

### colors
Colors are very important in design. I choose black as background and orange(\#e67e22) as highlight since black can gave the user a sense of music 
and functionality, orange can deliver cheerfulness and creativity (echo with client's personality) and can also be used to draw users' 
attention.

### typeface
I choose *Exo 2* on *google fonts* for this website. It will gave the user a futuristic feeling which goes well with the major color black
and the san-serif style will match with the modern overall design. By using only one font, the website will look consistent and neat.

### content
There are seven parts of the website to show all the information and feeling in order to accomplish our goal.
1.	Cover with motto - home : this is the first impression to deliver to the user, I want to show the user what's client's major in and his 
attitude and enthusiasm about it but not too straight forward in order to make the user scroll down with curiosity.
2.	Brief profile (headshot and skills) and Social media link - about : introduce the basic information of the client and the skills he has as well as
the social media links to help people know him better and encourage the user to connect with him.
3.	Audio portfolio - portfolio : show the sample music the client made to impress the user.
4.	Endorsement : three testimonies in this section to let the user know what kind of person/audio engineer the client is from different perspectives
which make it more convincing.
5.	Blog : display three latest blog from client's tumblr blog showing what he's up to and this website is up to date. 
6.	Contact form : collect user's information and send to the client by email, the email is sent by Javascript code doesn't need to invoke user's
local email app which make this website look more functional.
7.	Footer : display the designer name of this website.
